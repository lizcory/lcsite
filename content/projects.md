Affective Trajectories

[![Affect Trajectories Img](/viz/aff-traj-3.png)](https://lizcory.github.io/affective-trajectories/)

How do our feelings shift over time? Do we tread a similar affective path each day or chart a new one? This project illustrates the emotional journeys of six people over a two-week period. The design includes animation and small multiples to show how feelings can shift rapidly and intensely for some and stay stagnant for others.

This project presents a brief history of US Congressional testimony given by psychologists 1946-2016. Highlights from each decade are shown upon scrolling. Users can explore individual testimonies by brushing the final bar chart to update the table below it. A tree diagram at the end shows key witnesses by committee.

Vagus Nerve

The tenth cranial nerve in humans is called the "vagus," meaning "wandering" in Latin. True to its name, the vagus travels farther than any other nerve in the [autonomic nervous system](https://www.britannica.com/science/autonomic-nervous-system). Some of its most distant stops are in the gut. There, its "afferent" fibers‚Äîthose traveling up from the body to the brain‚Äîsense a mix of mechanical, chemical, and thermal information critical for regulating metabolism and eating. 

These illustrations cover the gross anatomy of the vagus its target organs in the gut. The key aim is to aid scientific exploration by synthesizing and simplifying complex anatomical information spread across [many research papers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ZI4LeGkfk-XaSoTpGH5MZz129sgaOmk7cBtNQrrCpI/edit?usp=sharing).

### COVIC
In 2020, I tagged and archived hundreds of visualizations for Northeastern's [COVID-19 Online Visualization Collection (COVIC)](https://covic-archive.org/index.html). The collection‚Äîwhich now contains over 10,000 figures‚Äîserves as a research tool, allowing users to filter charts and illustrations by type, interactive elements, and intended message.

### R Programming 
Over the past several years, I've come to really enjoy tinkering with new [R](https://www.r-project.org/) packages and sharing what I learn. For anyone interested in getting started with R, here's a list of free online courses I update every few months:
