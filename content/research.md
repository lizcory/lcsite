Current Projects
--
As a Research Technician in the [Interdisciplinary Affective Science Lab](https://www.affective-science.org/), I work on two longitudinal studies:

1. ðŸ“± **The first project tests the usability & efficacy of a smartphone-based stress resilience program.** 
    * **KEY QUESTION**: *Does this training program reduce psychological distress and physiological stress responses during a standardized stress task?*
    * **HOW**: We use a pre-/post- design and an active control group. Before and after training, we complete psychophysiological testing, including ambulatory electrocardiography (ECG), impedance cardiography (ICG), and blood pressure aquisition. Day to day, I oversee (remote) data collection & participant recruitment, manage undergraduate research assistants, and create data analysis & visualization pipelines in R.
    
2. ðŸ’“ **The second project aims to map individual variation in emotional experiences.** 
    * **KEY QUESTION**: *How do both the psychological and physiological components of real-world emotional experiences vary within and across individuals?*
    * **HOW**: For two weeks, participants are outfitted daily with ambulatory physiological recording sensors & devices. When significant changes in heart rate occur, they are prompted via smartphone to report on their emotional experiences. Before and after this two-week period, participants complete lab-based psychophysiological testing. We've collected one round of data and are preparing to collect a confirmatory sample when it is COVID-safe. 
        * Results from the first sample: ["Context-aware experience sampling reveals the scale of variation in affective experience."(Hoemann et. al, 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69180-y). 
        * An interactive visualization I designed & coded to illustrate the above paper's key findings: [Emotion Variation](https://lizcory.github.io/emotion-variation/).

Undergraduate Thesis
--

ðŸ¤” My honors thesis project investigated how people learn the efficacy of their cognitive effort. You can find a copy of my defense slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kELW9qbjPnlN2WxLBnIG2UhgR-GqpEHP/edit#slide=id.p1). This work was supervised by [Dr. Amitai Shenhav](https://www.shenhavlab.org/) and was awarded Brown University's Dean of the College Premium for Excellence in Cognitive Science.
