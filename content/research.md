Current Projects

As a Research Technician in the [Interdisciplinary Affective Science Lab](https://www.affective-science.org/), I've worked on two longitudinal studies:
    
1. ðŸ’“ **Mapping individual variation in emotional experiences.** 
    * **KEY QUESTION**: *How do both the psychological and physiological components of real-world emotional experiences vary within and across individuals?*
    * **METHOD**: For two weeks, participants wear ambulatory physiological recording equipment. Significant changes in heart rate trigger smartphone prompts asking participants about their emotions and current context. Before and after this two-week period, participants complete lab-based psychophysiological testing. We've collected one set of data and are now preparing to collect a confirmatory sample. 
        * Results from the first sample: ["Context-aware experience sampling reveals the scale of variation in affective experience."(Hoemann et. al, 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69180-y). 
        * An interactive visualization I designed & coded to illustrate the above paper's key findings: [Emotion Variation](https://lizcory.github.io/emotion-variation/).

2. ðŸ“± **Testing the usability & efficacy of a smartphone-based stress resilience program.** 
    * **KEY QUESTION**: *Does this training program reduce psychological distress and physiological stress responses during a standardized stress task?*
    * **METHOD**: We tested this program using a pre-/post- design and an active control group. Before and after the three-week training period, we measured participants' physiology and performance under stress. Day to day, I oversaw (remote) data collection & participant recruitment, supervised undergraduate research assistants, and created data analysis & visualization pipelines in R.

Undergraduate Thesis
--

ðŸ¤” My honors thesis project investigated how people learn the efficacy of their cognitive effort. You can find a copy of my defense slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kELW9qbjPnlN2WxLBnIG2UhgR-GqpEHP/edit#slide=id.p1). This work was supervised by [Dr. Amitai Shenhav](https://www.shenhavlab.org/) and was awarded Brown University's Dean of the College Premium for Excellence in Cognitive Science.
