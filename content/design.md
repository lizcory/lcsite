### Emotion Variation Interactive
[![Emo Var Img](/viz/emovarhome.png)](https://lizcory.github.io/emotion-variation/)

*OVERVIEW:* This interactive web visualization illustrates the variation in one person's emotional experiences over two weeks. The data are drawn from a recent research study run by the [Interdisciplinary Affective Science Lab](https://www.affective-science.org/). To unfold key trends in the data piece by piece, the design incorporates Javascript transition animations on page load and also features buttons that allow users to reconfigure the dataset into each slice at their own pace. I submitted this as a final project for a course in Northeastern's [Information Design & Data Visualization Masters of Science](https://camd.northeastern.edu/program/information-design-and-data-visualization-ms/) program.

### Vagus Nerve

*OVERVIEW:* The tenth cranial nerve in the human body is called the "vagus," which means "wandering" in Latin. True to its name, this nerve travels farther than any other nerve in the human [autonomic nervous system](https://www.britannica.com/science/autonomic-nervous-system). One of its most distant stops is in the gut. There, its "afferent" fibersâ€”those ascending from the body to the brainâ€”pick up on a variety of mechanical, chemical, and thermal information key to regulating metabolism and eating. This pair of illustrations schematizes the gross anatomy of the left and right vagus nerves and their target organs in the gut. My main aim for this project is to condense complicated anatomical information into a "map" that can aid scientific exploration and hypothesis generation. The drawings are informed by my reading of research on the vagus nerve's structure and function in both human and non-human animals. Please find my current reading list [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ZI4LeGkfk-XaSoTpGH5MZz129sgaOmk7cBtNQrrCpI/edit?usp=sharing).

### COVIC
Since October 2020, I've tagged and archived hundreds of visualizations for Northeastern's [COVID-19 Online Visualization Collection (COVIC)](https://medium.com/the-visual-agency/the-boston-view-visualizing-complex-data-covid-19-more-745d930d1d0). The collection, which now contains over 10,000 figures, is designed as a research tool, allowing users to filter charts and illustrations by type, interactive elements, and intended message.

### R Programming
Over the past year, I've coded over a dozen research- and design- related projects in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). I really enjoy tinkering with new packages and sharing what I learn. For anyone interested in getting started with R, I've compiled this list of free online courses:  
[Free R Programming and Statistics Courses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dcrgLhyRCJFPEuQwBQihwS3V4AVcZH41VTA8Ua5h3LI/edit?usp=sharing).

### Playground of Empathy
Alongside colleagues at the Interdisciplinary Affective Science Lab, I've provided scientific consultation on immersive design projects created by [Playground of Empathy](https://www.playgroundofempathy.com/playground).
