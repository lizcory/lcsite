Affective Trajectories
--
[![Affect Trajectories Img](/viz/aff-traj-3.png)](https://lizcory.github.io/affective-trajectories/)

**OVERVIEW:** How do our feelings shift over time? Do we tread a similar affective path each day or chart a new one? This project illustrates the emotional journeys of six individuals over a two-week period. The design includes animation and small multiples to highlight how feelings can shift rapidly and intensely for some and stay stagnant for others.

**OVERVIEW:** The United States Congress frequently calls on experts weigh in on proposed legislation. This project presents a brief history of US Congressional testimony given by psychologists 1946-2016. Highlights from each decade are shown using scrolling animations. After these highlights, users can to explore individual testimonies by brushing the final bar chart to update the table below it. The last visualization shows the top witnesses in committees with the most psychologist testimonies.

**OVERVIEW:** This visualization shows the variation in one person's emotional experiences and physiological patterns over two weeks. To unfold key trends in the data, the project features animations on page load and buttons allowing users to reconfigure the dataset at their own pace.

Vagus Nerve

**OVERVIEW:** The tenth cranial nerve in the human body is called the "vagus," meaning "wandering" in Latin. True to its name, the vagus travels farther than any other nerve in the human [autonomic nervous system](https://www.britannica.com/science/autonomic-nervous-system). Some of its most distant stops are in the gut. There, its "afferent" fibers‚Äîthose traveling up from the body to the brain‚Äîsense a variety of mechanical, chemical, and thermal information critical for regulating metabolism and eating. 

These illustrations cover the gross anatomy of the left and right vagus nerves and their target organs in the gut. Their aim is to aid scientific exploration and hypothesis generation by schematizing complex anatomical information. You can find the reading list that informed my drawings [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ZI4LeGkfk-XaSoTpGH5MZz129sgaOmk7cBtNQrrCpI/edit?usp=sharing).

### COVIC
In 2020, I tagged and archived hundreds of visualizations for Northeastern's [COVID-19 Online Visualization Collection (COVIC)](https://covic-archive.org/index.html). The collection, which now contains over 10,000 figures, serves as a research tool, allowing users to filter charts and illustrations by type, interactive elements, and intended message.

### R Programming 
Over the past couple of years, I've coded several research- and design- related projects in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). I really enjoy tinkering with new packages and sharing what I learn. For anyone interested in getting started with R, here is a list of free online courses that I update every few months:

### Playground of Empathy
Alongside colleagues at the Interdisciplinary Affective Science Lab, I've provided scientific consultation on immersive design projects created by [Playground of Empathy](https://www.playgroundofempathy.com/playground).
